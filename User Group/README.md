# Saviynt UserGroup Transport Files

This collection contains additional transport files, including those for **UserGroup** configurations, to support efficient migration and setup of user grouping across various environments.

## Understanding Saviynt UserGroups
In Saviynt, **UserGroups** are logical groupings of users that streamline the management of user permissions, access requests, and approval processes. By grouping users with similar access needs, organizations can more effectively manage identity and access control, simplifying the process of applying, updating, and reviewing permissions for multiple users at once.

## Key Benefits of UserGroups

- **Simplified Access Management**: Administrators can assign access permissions to an entire group instead of individual users, saving time and reducing errors.
  
- **Streamlined Access Request Workflows**: UserGroups can be integrated into access request workflows, where approval and notification settings are defined at the group level. This ensures efficient, consistent processes for users with similar roles.
  
- **Efficient Auditing and Reporting**: Group-based access facilitates auditing, making it easier to track access permissions and generate reports on group-based access, supporting compliance and accountability.

By including UserGroup transport files in this collection, organizations can ensure consistent and controlled configurations across different environments, helping maintain streamlined access management and efficient user grouping.
