# Post-Implementation Artifacts

## Overview

In **Saviynt**, post-implementation artifacts are typically used by the **Operations team** to update entitlements, user attributes, and account properties in alignment with organizational requirements. These tasks can be performed through the **Saviynt UI** or by utilizing available artifacts from Saviynt forums. This collection provides examples of such artifacts to guide partners or implementation teams in generating these files, helping to reduce errors and improve efficiency for the **Managed Services team**.

These artifacts are especially useful for **UAT**, **DEMO**, and **Testing** activities. They allow you to modify objects and monitor events, enabling you to test use cases and integrations effectively.

## Importance of Providing Tested Artifacts to Support Teams

It is essential for **Identity Governance (IGA)** and **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** implementation teams to provide **tested artifacts** to the **Support teams**. By ensuring that artifacts are thoroughly tested before being passed on, the following benefits can be achieved:

- **Reduced Errors**: Tested artifacts help prevent common mistakes during the support phase, ensuring smoother operations.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Well-tested artifacts reduce the time needed to troubleshoot issues, allowing the support team to focus on other critical tasks.
- **Faster Incident Resolution**: When artifacts are pre-tested, the risk of configuration errors is minimized, which streamlines the troubleshooting process.
- **Better Communication**: Clear documentation and tested artifacts ensure that all teams (implementation, operations, and support) are aligned and can collaborate more effectively.

## Benefits of Using Tested Artifacts

- **Enhanced Quality Control**: Pre-tested artifacts reduce the chance of implementation errors, which leads to higher system stability.
- **Streamlined Support**: Properly tested artifacts improve the overall efficiency of the post-implementation support phase.
- **Better User Satisfaction**: By ensuring that everything is tested thoroughly, organizations can enhance the reliability of their Identity Governance and PAM solutions, providing better service to end users.

## Conclusion

Providing thoroughly tested post-implementation artifacts to support teams is crucial in ensuring the stability and efficiency of **Saviynt IGA** and **PAM** systems. By reducing errors and improving the speed of issue resolution, tested artifacts lead to smoother operations and more successful deployments.
