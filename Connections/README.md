# Saviynt Connection Setup and Sample Collection

This collection is provided as a sample only. Please review the latest documentation before running jobs or importing data to ensure compliance with the most current best practices and guidelines.

## Saviynt Connections Overview

In **Saviynt**, **Connections** define how the platform integrates with external systems, applications, or data sources. These connections are essential for enabling automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and other identity governance and administration tasks. Connections can be set up for various systems, including Active Directory, LDAP, cloud applications, databases, and more.

### Key Aspects of Saviynt Connections:

- **Configuration**: Connections are configured with specific settings such as endpoints, authentication methods, and data mappings to ensure seamless integration with external systems.
- **Data Sync**: Saviynt uses connections to synchronize user and access data between the platform and external systems. This synchronization ensures that changes made within Saviynt reflect across the connected systems.
- **Security**: Connections require proper security configurations, such as credentials or tokens, to ensure that sensitive information is securely transmitted and accessed.
- **Error Handling**: Saviynt allows administrators to monitor the health of connections and address any issues such as authentication failures or connectivity problems.

## Important Notes:
- Ensure that all connections are properly configured and tested before importing or syncing data to avoid potential errors or security issues.
- Review the latest Saviynt documentation to stay up-to-date with best practices, security guidelines, and configuration requirements.
