# Saviynt Schema Jobs

Saviynt Schema Jobs are essential for maintaining data alignment between Saviynt and connected applications, supporting critical processes such as provisioning, access control, compliance, and risk management. Schema Jobs ensure that Saviynt has accurate, up-to-date information on user attributes, roles, and entitlements, enabling effective identity governance and administration.


## Key Functions

### 1. Schema Discovery and Metadata Mapping
Schema Jobs allow Saviynt to discover the structure and metadata of connected systems, such as Active Directory and SAP Ariba. By retrieving metadata, Saviynt can understand data structures and attributes related to users, roles, and entitlements. This process includes:
- Identifying key attributes (e.g., userID, email, first name, last name).
- Mapping these attributes to Saviynt’s data model, establishing a seamless connection between Saviynt and external systems.

### 2. User and Entitlement Aggregation
Schema Jobs are crucial for aggregating user and entitlement data from connected applications. Using the synchronized schema, Saviynt can pull identities and entitlements (e.g., roles, permissions, groups) from external systems. Aggregated data is used for:
- Provisioning
- Access reviews
- Compliance checks
- Risk assessments

### 3. Provisioning and Access Management
Accurate schema information is key to Saviynt’s provisioning capabilities, which involve creating, updating, or deleting user accounts across applications. With up-to-date schema information:
- Provisioning can proceed without errors, as it reflects the current structure and entitlements in connected systems.
- Access requests can be handled efficiently, as requested access is matched to the latest data.

### 4. Compliance and Access Certification
Schema Jobs assist with access certification by ensuring Saviynt maintains an accurate view of entitlements and roles within connected systems. This is essential for:
- Precise risk assessment and compliance reporting, allowing Saviynt to evaluate user access based on policy.
- Access reviews by administrators to ensure all access aligns with organizational compliance standards.
