# Saviynt Workflows

Saviynt workflows are structured processes within the Saviynt Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) platform, designed to automate and control various identity and access management (IAM) tasks. Workflows ensure secure, repeatable, and auditable processes for access provisioning, de-provisioning, approval, and more, tailored to an organization’s specific requirements and compliance needs.

## How Saviynt Workflows Work

### 1. Workflow Triggers
Workflows in Saviynt are triggered by predefined events, such as:
   - A user requesting access to an application.
   - Detection of unused access requiring removal.
   - Periodic recertification processes or lifecycle events (e.g., onboarding).

These events automatically initiate the relevant workflow to ensure consistency and compliance.

### 2. Workflow Components
Saviynt workflows are composed of several key components:

   - **Approval Blocks**: Define approval stages and routing, including manager, peer, or security checks. Approvals can be multi-level, based on organizational policies.
   - **Condition Blocks**: Control the workflow’s direction based on specific conditions, such as requester’s role, access criticality, or risk score.
   - **Action Blocks**: Represent specific actions, like provisioning access, sending notifications, or escalating requests.
   - **Notification Blocks**: Send notifications (via email, SMS, etc.) to keep stakeholders informed at each stage.
   - **Escalation Rules**: Prevent workflow stalling by escalating to higher authorities if approvals aren’t completed within a defined timeframe.

### 3. Approval Chains and Routing Logic
Workflows support multiple levels of approvals, dynamically routing tasks based on request attributes. Routing logic can accommodate complex chains, sending approvals to managers, team leaders, or specialized approvers based on department, region, or access type.

### 4. Customizable Workflow Templates
Saviynt offers out-of-the-box workflow templates for common IAM tasks, such as user onboarding, access removal, and certification. These templates are customizable, allowing for additional decision points, approval stages, or notifications to meet specific requirements.

### 5. Audit and Compliance
Every workflow step is logged for audit and compliance purposes. This enables easy reporting on actions, such as who approved a request or when access was modified, which is critical for meeting regulatory requirements like SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA.

### 6. Integration with External Systems
Saviynt workflows integrate with various IT and HR systems, including Active Directory, ServiceNow, SAP, and other identity repositories. Using APIs and connectors, workflows can interact with other systems, synchronize data, and automate actions, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

## Example: Access Removal Workflow

An example of how a Saviynt access removal workflow functions:

1. **Trigger**: A user requests access removal, or an automatic check flags unused access.
2. **Approval Stage**: The request is routed to the user's manager for approval.
3. **Decision Point**:
   - If the manager approves, the workflow proceeds with access removal.
   - If denied, a notification is sent to the requester.
4. **Notification and Escalation**: Notifications inform the requester and stakeholders of the outcome. If there is no manager response within a set time, the request escalates to a secondary approver.
5. **Audit Logging**: Every step is logged for reporting and compliance purposes.

## Benefits of Saviynt Workflows
Saviynt workflows improve IAM operations by automating access requests, enhancing security, and reducing administrative overhead. This structured, flexible approach to IAM supports consistent security policy enforcement and improves compliance with industry regulations.
