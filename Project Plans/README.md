# IGA and PAM Project Implementation Plan Templates

This collection covers project plans for managing **IGA** (Identity Governance and Administration) and **CPAM** (Saviynt Cloud Privileged Access Management) implementation projects. These templates can be used by architects to create a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** and assist project managers in developing detailed project plans based on the project scope.

## High-Level Steps for IGA and PAM Project Implementation

### 1. **Project Initiation**
   - Define the project scope and objectives.
   - Identify stakeholders and assign project roles.
   - Develop a high-level project plan and timeline.
   - Explore Connectivity Options.

### 2. **Establish Connectvity**
   - Conduct workshops with key stakeholders to find best connectivity options.
   - Document and request Infrastructure components including firewall rules with chnage approvals.
   - Implement and Test

### 3. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis**
   - Conduct workshops with key stakeholders to gather business and technical requirements.
   - Document current access management processes and identify gaps.
   - Define policies, roles, and workflows for IGA and PAM systems.

### 4. **Design Phase**
   - Design the solution architecture for both IGA and PAM systems.
   - Design user roles, access workflows, and policies.
   - Define system integrations (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, HR systems).
   - Review and approve designs with stakeholders.

### 5. **Development and Configuration**
   - Configure the IGA platform (e.g., provisioning, role-based access control, policy management).
   - Configure the PAM solution (e.g., privileged account management, session monitoring).
   - Integrate with third-party systems (e.g., databases, network infrastructure).
   - Perform unit testing for each configured component.

### 6. **Testing Phase**
   - Perform system integration testing (SIT).
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with end-users and key stakeholders.
   - Address any issues identified during testing.

### 7. **Deployment and Go-Live**
   - Deploy the IGA and PAM solutions in the production environment.
   - Migrate existing user and privileged account data to the new systems.
   - Provide training to administrators and end-users on the new solution.

### 8. **Post-Go-Live Support and Optimization**
   - Monitor system performance and address any operational issues.
   - Fine-tune configurations based on user feedback.
   - Conduct a post-implementation review and identify areas for continuous improvement.

## Benefits of Using This Template Collection

- **Structured Approach**: Helps in creating a well-defined and systematic implementation plan.
- **Efficient Planning**: Facilitates the breakdown of tasks and helps in resource allocation.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures that all key phases of the project, from initiation to post-go-live, are accounted for.

By following this collection of templates and high-level steps, you can successfully manage and execute your **IGA** and **PAM** implementation projects, ensuring a smooth deployment and effective solution integration.
